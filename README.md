# Medi-Sync
Medi-Sync is a webapp developed to improve the current medical record system with a digitize portfolio in order to improve efficiency and organization. 
By using a shareable link, the patient can share their medical records with their dotors and other health workers such as pharmacists.
We provide a variety of statistics as well as a "Health Index" which allows the information to be more accessible to both the doctor and patient.
We plan on allowing the patient to pick and choose what information is being sent to different people as well. 
We take data inputted by the user and information provided by the FitBit API and store it on a Firebase database.
